      <h2>Kim</h2>
      “Sammie looked after Riley for a week in October and I was able to go away, worry-free, 
      knowing he was in good hands with the benefit of being in his own home. Riley is a bit clingy and doesn’t really like change, 
      so Sammie came and got to know him in his own home and then took him for a weekly walk up until the time of our holiday. He absolutely adores her and we have 
      continued with the regular walks. I was in when she came to collect him the other day and I can honestly say even I don’t
      get the welcome he gave Sammie! I know now that instead of dreading holidays, I can look forward to going away and know that Riley will be well looked after and happy. ”
      
      <h2>Nadia</h2>
      “Our 2 dogs had the pleasure of being looked after by Sammie while we were away on holiday. 
      I felt so comfortable with Sammie and knew they were in very safe and capable hands! We've already booked in for our 
      next holiday! Can't recommend Sammie enough - came home to a very well kept house and very happy doggies!”

      <h2>Aimee and Dan</h2> 
      “Sammie was recommended to us by a family member. We were extremely anxious about who we would leave our dog with, as 
      he can be really funny about meeting new people. We asked Sammie to walk Dave a few times before the big day, so that 
      Dave could get to know her a bit. Sammie then stayed overnight at our house to look after Dave and our cat, 
      we felt so at ease knowing Dave was being looked after by someone that he was truly comfortable with. Since Sammie has been walking Dave his
      nervousness towards new people has come on leaps and bounds. She now walks Dave for us twice a week, all we have to do 
      now is say her name and Dave's tail immediately starts to wag. We cannot recommend Sammie enough, it's clear to see she loves her job and 
      the animals she looks after. We are so pleased we have found her....and so's Dave!!!” - Aimee and Dan
      
      <h2>Jasmine</h2>
      “I've just been away for a week to the south of France, Sammie looked after our cat, rabbit and fish and we've 
      come back to amazingly happy animals! Amazing care, happy animals! I'd definitely use Sammie's services again in the future, highly recommended!”

					<h3>A little bit about Sammie</h3>
					<p>
					I live in Chawton along with our elderly Labrador, two nutty Cocker Spaniels, six chickens, one pampered hamster and ten tone of fish. 
         I've always had a passion for animals, especially dogs! Growing up, my family have owned a variety of pets, ranging from ferrets to rabbits. 
         After leaving college with two diplomas in media, I decided it really wasn't for me, so I began searching for something new. 
         After 8 years working at the local bistro, I finally decided to leave my job and combine my two
         passions, animals and the outdoors. Everyday I'm I'm extremely thankful I made the decision, and I'm glad to say I finally love what I'm doing.
